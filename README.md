<h1 align="center">Red Panda üêº</h1>


## Introduction

In certain scenarios, we may seek a lighter alternative to Kafka, and that alternative could be Red Panda. In this repository,
I explore using Red Panda as a Kafka replacement with Go. For Kafka integration in Go,
I rely on [franz-go](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go). Additionally, other alternatives include [Confluent Kafka](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go) and [Sarama](https://github.com/IBM/sarama).
